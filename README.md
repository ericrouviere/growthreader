# Growthreader

Python utilities for processing Agilent LP600 plate reader exports. The project
loads the “Raw Data” worksheets from an LP600 workbook, blanks the plate,
computes per-well log₂ growth rates, and produces CSV and PDF reports that make
it easy to audit growth behaviour across the plate.

## Features
- Parse every `*- Raw Data` worksheet from an Agilent LP600 Excel workbook.
- Convert instrument timestamps to monotonic hours, blank wells, and fit
  log₂(OD) models to configurable OD windows.
- Export growth rates plus the OD bounds that were used for each well so the
  fit window can be reviewed and tuned.
- Generate plate-wide growth-curve grids (log and linear) as well as heatmaps
  of the fitted slopes.
- Reuse the `growth_curves_module.py` helpers directly from notebooks or other
  analysis scripts.

## Repository layout
- `pyproject.toml` – package metadata for the installable `growthreader`
  library (`pip install -e .` exposes it system-wide).
- `src/growthreader/` – reusable code (pipeline, plotting, utilities). This is
  the only directory you reinstall/update when improving the core logic.
- `measure_growth_rates_script.py` – turnkey script that imports the installed
  package. Copy this script next to any new dataset, tweak the config block at
  the top, and run it without touching the library again.
- `LP600_example.xlsx` – sample workbook for testing.
- `growth_rates.csv` / `plots/` – outputs generated by the script (regenerated
  whenever you re-run it).

## Requirements
- Python 3.9 or newer (tested with Python 3.11).
- Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.

Install the package once into a virtual environment or your preferred Python
install:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

Once installed you *do not need to copy the codebase* again—just copy or
symlink `measure_growth_rates_script.py`, adjust the paths at the top, and run
it. All heavy logic lives in the installed package.

## Quick start
1. Install the package once (`pip install -e .`) from the repo root. Future
   updates only need a `git pull`.
2. Copy `measure_growth_rates_script.py` into your data directory (or run it in
   place) and set `WORKBOOK_PATH` to your LP600 workbook path.
2. Adjust the configuration block near the top of
   `measure_growth_rates_script.py`. Important knobs include:
   - `blank_points`: how many of the lowest OD readings to average per well.
   - `default_od_min` / `default_od_max`: OD bounds for the log₂ fit.
   - `window_size`: number of consecutive points that must exceed `OD_min`
     before the fit can start.
   - `growth_rates_csv` / `plots_dir`: output locations.
3. Run the pipeline from the directory containing the script:
   ```bash
   python measure_growth_rates_script.py
   ```
4. Inspect `growth_rates.csv` to review the slopes and (optionally) edit the
   `OD_min`/`OD_max` columns per well. Re-running the script respects those
   overrides, making it easy to tighten/loosen fit windows on a well-by-well
   basis.
5. Open the PDFs inside `plots/` to visually audit the raw curves and the
   heatmaps of per-plate growth rates.

## Simulation regression test
To verify the pipeline end-to-end, run the bundled regression test:

```bash
python tests/simulated_growth_pipeline_test.py
```

The script synthesizes a deterministic LP600 workbook, executes the same
pipeline used in `measure_growth_rates_script.py`, and writes the outputs to
`tests/simulated_growth_curves.xlsx`, `tests/growth_rates_test.csv`, and
`tests/test_plots/`. It then compares every inferred log₂ growth rate against
the known ground truth slopes and prints per-well relative differences before
reporting PASS/FAIL. Use this test whenever you modify the fitting logic or
plotting routines to ensure the numerical behaviour stays consistent.

## Using the module directly
Once installed, the helpers can be imported anywhere:

```python
from growthreader.growth_curves_module import (
    load_raw_data,
    compute_time_in_hours,
    fit_log_od_growth_rates,
)

plates = load_raw_data("LP600_example.xlsx")
plate_df = plates["Plate 1 - Raw Data"]
time_hours = compute_time_in_hours(plate_df["Time"])
slopes, fit_windows, _ = fit_log_od_growth_rates(plate_df, time_hours)
```

This makes it straightforward to embed the logic inside notebooks or larger
automation pipelines.

## Troubleshooting
- **No `*- Raw Data` sheets found** – confirm the sheet names in your workbook
  match the LP600 default naming. You can adjust `RAW_SUFFIX` inside
  `src/growthreader/growth_curves_module.py` if your export uses a different
  suffix.
- **NaN growth rates** – usually indicates the OD never exceeded `OD_min`,
  there were not enough consecutive points (see `WINDOW_SIZE`), or all values in
  the fit window were non-positive. Inspect the per-well curve PDFs to pick a
  better OD window.
- **Heatmaps look clipped** – set `HEATMAP_VMIN`/`HEATMAP_VMAX` in the script to
  enforce fixed colour limits across plates.
- **Fontconfig cache errors** – the script now creates local `.cache/` and
  `.matplotlib_cache/` directories automatically, but if you run the pipeline
  elsewhere ensure `MPLCONFIGDIR`/`XDG_CACHE_HOME` point to writable paths.

Feel free to open issues or submit PRs if you extend the workflow for other
plate formats or instruments.
